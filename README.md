# Black-Jack-Simulator
This python program strives to generate artificial randomness using the execution of multiple parallel processes deployed by the MacOS. The randomness generated from the timed-completion of each process provides aid to the Blackjack game. The point of this project was to create consistent randomness without utelizing libraries provided externally or by Python.
